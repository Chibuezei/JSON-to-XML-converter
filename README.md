# About
Today, XML and JSON are the most popular formats of data that can be understood both by computers and by humans. These formats are used to exchange information between servers, between various components in a single application, and much more. JSON and XML are data formats that allow us to store data in a way that is readable by both a computer and a human. JSON and XML are common formats of storing data, and since both are used, it is sometimes necessary to convert one format into the other.
